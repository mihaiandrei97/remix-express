# Welcome to Remix!

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.

### Google Provider

By default, this starter only comes with the google provider which you'll need to setup:

1. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. create a new project
3. setup oauth consent screen
4. create credentials - oauth client id
5. for authorized javascript origins

- http://localhost:3000
- https://your-domain.com

6. Authorized redirect URIs

- http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
- https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google

7. Set your google id and secret inside of .env

- **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**
- **GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**
